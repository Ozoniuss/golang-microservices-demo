## Configs

This is straight out of the suggested [standard project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout/tree/master/configs). It is the default location of the configuration file(s), and by default, the service searches for a yaml configuration file called `config.yml` at this location. The location and name of the configuration file can be overwritten, if desired.

The project uses my [configer](https://github.com/Ozoniuss/configer) package to handle configuration. Check out the link for more details and usage.
